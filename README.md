### Overview
This project explores the current state of the job market and employs bayesian methods to model income.

Prompted by a discussion with my friend, I investigate the following questions:

- How hard is the job market for recent grads?

- Which degrees and demographic groups face the greatest threat of **under**employment?

- How does future income vary with education and geography?

### Key Features
